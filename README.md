General Information

Dataset
-----------------------
New York City publishes a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. The data we work with is from this dataset, which is stored inside a CSV file (around 1.5GB).
